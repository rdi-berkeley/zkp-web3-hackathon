<!-- Submit a writeup detailing the computations of the two blockchains implemented in ZKP. In addition, submit a proof-of-concept implementation of the ZKP scheme and the smart contracts on the two blockchains to verify the proofs. -->

Contribute to an open source framework and suite to build bridging solutions between blockchains using ZKP protocols, help build a secure, universal foundation for multichain interoperability, in partnership with [zkcollective](https://zkcollective.org/).

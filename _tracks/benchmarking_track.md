<!-- Given a set of benchmarks (SHA256, BLAKE3, Merkle tree path verification, etc.), report the performance of a selected ZKP scheme. The report should include the security level, the specification of the testbed, the prover time, the proof size and the verifier time. Ideally the ZKP scheme should consume the standard implementation in R1CS, Plonkish IR or plain circuit. -->

<!-- Given a specification of the zkrollup computation and a reference circuit compiled by existing libraries in R1CS/Plonk format, reduce the total size of the rollup circuit while preserving the correctness. For example, the participants can design custom gates and lookup arguments in Plonk and other ZKP backends to optimize the prover time. Submit a writeup explaining the optimizations, the improvement on the prover time and any trade-off on the proof size/verifier time. The prize will be given to submissions with the fastest prover time. -->

Optimize common ZKP circuits to improve performance while preserving correctness.

<h2>Category 1: Aleo ZK Gaming</h2>
<ul>
   <li>
      Turn-based games (e.g. Battleship), Table games (e.g. Poker), RPG (e.g. Dark Forest) 
      <ul>
         <li>
            Write your application using <a href="https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo">Leo</a>  
            <ul>
               <li><a href="https://github.com/AleoHQ/workshop/tree/master/battleship">Reference of Battleship written in Leo</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
         <li>
            Use our <a href="https://github.com/AleoHQ/aleo-js">JavaScript library</a> and create a simple UI that web-based users can interact with to play your game  
            <ul>
               <li><a href="https://aleo.tools/">Reference of our JS library being used to create a web application</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
         <li>Deploy your application using <a href="https://developer.aleo.org/testnet/getting_started/deploy_execute">Deploy and Execute</a></li>
         <li>Verify your application is successfully deployed</li>
         <li>Share your artifacts, e.g., GitHub repo, any planning docs, specifications, etc. </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ul>
<h3>Prize allocation breakdown</h3>
<p>
   Total of $30,000 split amongst ten different prizes (like in a science fair):
</p>
<ul>
   <li>ZK-maxi: One prize of $12,500</li>
   <li>ZK-expert: One prize of $7,500</li>

</ul>
<h2>
   Category 2:  ZK for enabling mobile use cases
</h2>
<p>
   Best use of ZK for enabling mobile use-cases. For example, improvements to mobile hw support (for more information see <a href="https://docs.celo.org/protocol/plumo">Celo’s Plumo</a>, zk-SNARK based system that allows mobile and resource constrained nodes on the Celo network to sync to the Celo blockchain faster and with less data) or any other lightweight client type support. 
</p>
<p>
   Prize: $5,000 (award provided by Celo)
</p>

<h2>
   Self-Selected Tasks
</h2>
<p>
   Prize: Up to $3000 for 1st place, Up to $2000 for 2nd place and Up to $1000 for 3rd place.
</p>

<h2>
Category 3: Polkadot PoCs, Papers & More
</h2>

<p>
We seek proof-of-concept cryptographic back ends, or interesting student papers or pre-specs, which should be Polkadot flavored in the broadest possible sense.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>As proof-of-concept code: </em></strong>Anything novel goes, provided the prover and verifier use Arkworks or Rust more generally. Avoid smart contract languages or higher-level platform specific zk languages. A few ideas include…
</p>
<ul>

<li><em>Games:</em>  </li>

<li><em>Batch verifiers:</em>  </li>

<li><em>Avoid full ZK roll ups though</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong><em>Student papers or pre-specs: </em></strong>A few ideas include…
</p>
<ul>

<li><em>User-collator MPC:</em> </li>

<li><em>Exploit user-collator anonymity:</em> </li>

<li><em>Inter-collator MPC:</em> </li>
</ul>

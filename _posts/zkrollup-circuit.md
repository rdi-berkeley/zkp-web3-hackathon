Given a specification of the zkrollup computation and a reference circuit compiled by existing libraries in R1CS/Plonk format, reduce the total size of the rollup circuit while preserving the correctness. For example, the participants can design custom gates and lookup arguments in Plonk and other ZKP backends to optimize the prover time.

Submit a writeup explaining the optimizations, the improvement on the prover time and any trade-off on the proof size/verifier time. The prize will be given to submissions with the fastest prover time.


**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
